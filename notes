all turtles run at one y-level (probably about 32)
many turtles may just wake up and broadcast asking for commands

keep track of regions
	with rectangular regions
	no region â‡’ not allowed to roam (these turtles can't go there)
	regions may be clear or wild
		clear being entirely mined out, no obstacles
		wild being whatever, might need to mine
		refill in wild
			one thing I'm not sure about is filling in paths in wild regions
			so that after a turtle has gone through it has to refill
			but that's complicated and annoying
			not doing that makes wild vs clear not very useful (maybe still for inventory requirements)
		inv requirements for wild
			must have enough inventory space to mine in the wild
			so the manhattan distance (possibly times something because different items don't stack)
			also balancing pathing in the clear (free) vs pathing in the wild
				I think it should be possible to optimize the graph to one edge per clear region
	mark minable on regions?

multi chunk
	talk to a command computer in spawn chunks about chunkloading
	TODO: how much does a single /forceload load?
		3x3, only the first chunk ticks entities
	each chunk needs an ender modem
		or only a regular modem if there's a repeater with an ender modem (in spawn chunks)
	adjacent chunks may have a way to transfer items
		or may just have connected wired networks
			TODO: how do wired networks work when partially loaded?
				doesn't matter
		TODO: does a full block wired modem connect networks?
	TODO: pathing along these
		some long distance paths might just take turtles
	TODO: should each chunk be independent or should some be linked
		relevant for ender modems

storage
	TODO: how does placing chests work now?

turtle v turtle
	what happens when two turtles collide?
	they can wrap each other, get the IDs and start negotiating
	if they are perpendicular then it will resolve itself
